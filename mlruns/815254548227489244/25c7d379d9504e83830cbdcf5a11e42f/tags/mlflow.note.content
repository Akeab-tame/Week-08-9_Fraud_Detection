### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a specialized deep learning model primarily used for processing grid-like data, such as images. It is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers. CNNs are made up of three key components:

**Convolutional layers:** These layers apply convolutional filters (kernels) to input data, detecting features like edges, textures, and shapes.
**Pooling layers:** These reduce the dimensionality of the data, focusing on the most important features while maintaining spatial structure.
**Fully connected layers:** At the end, these layers connect every neuron from the previous layer to the output, typically used for classification.

CNNs are widely used in image recognition, object detection, and computer vision tasks.
